# Haterate-speech-detection

With the rise of user-generated content, monitoring hate speech has become increasingly important.

This project involves:

1.Cleaning and preprocessing a labeled dataset of text data.

2.Training multiple machine learning models to classify hate vs non-hate content.

3.Evaluating and comparing model performance using various metrics.

4.Visualizing performance and deploying the model pipeline (optional).
